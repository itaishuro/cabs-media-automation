## Media Server Log Cleanup Script

### Purpose
The Media Server Log Cleanup Script is designed to automatically remove accumulated log files generated by the media server. This prevents excessive disk usage, which could otherwise lead to system instability or interruptions in media playback services.

---

### Location
The cleanup process is implemented as a **scheduled task** on the media server and is managed through **Task Scheduler**.

---

### Viewing or Modifying the Script
To review or update the log cleanup script:

1. Open **Task Scheduler** on the media server.
2. Locate the task named **“Clear Media Server Logs”** (or a similarly named task).
3. Right-click the task and select **Properties**.
4. Navigate to the **Actions** tab.
5. The configured script or command used to clear the logs will be displayed and can be modified if necessary.

---

### Schedule
- **Execution Frequency:** Every two weeks
- **Operation Mode:** Fully automated
- **Purpose:** Ensures regular maintenance without requiring manual intervention

---

### Notes
- The task runs in the background and does not impact normal media server operations.
- Any changes to the script should be tested carefully to avoid unintended deletion of required files.
- It is recommended to review the task periodically to confirm it is running as expected.
